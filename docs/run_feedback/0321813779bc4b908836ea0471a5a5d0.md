# Post-Implementation Self-Reflection

## üîç Low-Value Time Sinks
No significant time sinks were encountered during this task. The implementation was straightforward and followed the existing patterns in the codebase. The repository structure was clear, and the existing agent implementations provided good examples to follow.

There were no loops where approaches were retried multiple times. The implementation was completed in a single pass.

## üß≠ Lessons Learned & Efficiency Boosters
The task startup was smooth as the repository structure was well-organized. The existing agent implementations (PlannerAgent, FeedbackSynthesizerAgent) provided clear patterns to follow for the new placeholder agents.

One insight was the importance of understanding the existing data models before implementing new agents. The data_models.py file contained all the necessary models that could be reused for the new agents.

If I had to do this task again, I would approach it the same way - first understanding the existing patterns and then implementing the new agents following those patterns.

## üß± Issues Encountered
No significant issues were encountered during the implementation. The task was clear, and the existing codebase provided good examples to follow.

One assumption made was that the PlannerTool and DetailerTool should be implemented as standalone agents similar to the existing ones, rather than using the OpenAI Agents SDK `function_tool` decorator. This assumption was based on the lack of evidence of using the `function_tool` decorator in the codebase and the instruction to create "placeholder" implementations.

The implementation focused on creating minimal placeholder functionality as instructed, avoiding the issue encountered with the previous FeedbackSynthesizerAgent implementation that went beyond the intended scope.
