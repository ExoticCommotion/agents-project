# Post-Implementation Self-Reflection: FeedbackSynthesizerAgent

## üîç Low-Value Time Sinks
- Initially spent time searching for specific details about AIPM-V0-01 when the task was clear from the code itself - implementing the FeedbackSynthesizerAgent.
- Had to fix type annotation errors for Counter objects, which could have been avoided by properly specifying the generic type parameters from the start.

## üß≠ Lessons Learned & Efficiency Boosters
- The existing agent implementations provided a clear pattern to follow, making it easier to understand the expected behavior.
- Looking at the test file first gave clear requirements for what the implementation needed to do.
- The data models were well-defined, which made it straightforward to understand the input and output structures.
- If I had to do this task again, I would start by examining the test file and related agent implementations first to understand the requirements better before searching for specific task details.

## üß± Issues Encountered
- Had to resolve merge conflicts with the uv.lock file, which was handled by pulling the latest changes.
- Encountered type checking errors with the Counter objects, which required adding proper generic type parameters.
- The implementation required careful consideration of how to process the input data to generate meaningful learning proposals.
