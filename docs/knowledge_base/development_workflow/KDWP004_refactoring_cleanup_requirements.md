# KDWP004: Refactoring Cleanup Requirements

## Overview

When refactoring code structures, particularly when moving functionality from one location to another, it is **critical** to clean up old duplicate files after migrating the functionality. Failing to do so can lead to confusion, maintenance issues, and potential bugs.

## Key Principles

1. **Complete Removal**: After migrating functionality to a new location, the old files should be completely removed from the codebase.

2. **Update All References**: All references to the old files must be updated to point to the new locations. This includes:
   - Import statements
   - Test files
   - Documentation
   - Configuration files

3. **Verify No Duplicates**: Before completing a refactoring task, verify that there are no duplicate implementations of the same functionality.

4. **Test Thoroughly**: After removing old files, run all tests to ensure that the removal did not break any functionality.

## Checklist for Refactoring Tasks

When refactoring code structures, follow this checklist:

- [ ] Identify all files that need to be moved or refactored
- [ ] Create new files with the refactored functionality
- [ ] Update all references to the old files
- [ ] Run tests to ensure the new structure works correctly
- [ ] Remove the old files
- [ ] Update any remaining references to the old files
- [ ] Run tests again to ensure no functionality was broken
- [ ] Verify no uncommitted or unstaged files remain

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Partial Refactoring**: Moving only some files while leaving others in the old location.
2. **Missed References**: Failing to update all references to the old files.
3. **Incomplete Testing**: Not running tests after removing old files.
4. **Leaving Duplicates**: Keeping both old and new implementations in the codebase.

## Best Practices

1. Use search tools to find all references to the old files.
2. Create a list of all files that need to be updated before starting the refactoring.
3. Commit changes in logical groups to make the refactoring easier to review.
4. Run tests frequently during the refactoring process.
5. Use git status to verify no uncommitted or unstaged files remain.

By following these guidelines, you can ensure that refactoring tasks are completed properly and do not introduce technical debt or confusion into the codebase.
