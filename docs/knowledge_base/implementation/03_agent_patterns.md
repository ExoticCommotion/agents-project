# Agent Patterns Implementation Guide

This guide provides detailed information about implementing the different agent patterns supported by the OpenAI Agents SDK in this project.

## 1. Single Agent Pattern

The Single Agent Pattern is the simplest pattern, suitable for straightforward tasks with minimal complexity.

### Implementation Example

```python
from openai_agents import Agent, AgentState, Message, SingleAgentWorkflow

class SimpleAgent(Agent):
    async def run(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
        # Process the latest message
        latest_message = state.messages[-1]

        # Generate a response
        response = "This is a simple response"

        # Add the response to the state
        state.messages.append(
            Message(role="assistant", content=response)
        )

        return state

# Create a workflow with the agent
workflow = SingleAgentWorkflow(agent=SimpleAgent())
```

## 2. Tool Integration Pattern

The Tool Integration Pattern allows agents to access external data or functions via the `function_tool` decorator.

### Implementation Example

```python
from openai_agents import Agent, AgentState, Message, SingleAgentWorkflow, function_tool

class ToolUsingAgent(Agent):
    @function_tool
    def get_weather(self, location: str) -> dict:
        # In a real implementation, this would call a weather API
        return {"temperature": 72, "condition": "sunny"}

    async def run(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
        # Process the latest message and potentially use tools
        # ...
        return state

# Create a workflow with the agent
workflow = SingleAgentWorkflow(agent=ToolUsingAgent())
```

## 3. Agent Routing Pattern

The Agent Routing Pattern directs queries to specialized agents based on content type.

### Implementation Example

```python
from openai_agents import Agent, AgentState, Message, RouterAgentWorkflow

class RouterAgent(Agent):
    async def run(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
        # Determine which specialized agent should handle the query
        # ...
        return state

class WeatherAgent(Agent):
    async def run(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
        # Handle weather-related queries
        # ...
        return state

class NewsAgent(Agent):
    async def run(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
        # Handle news-related queries
        # ...
        return state

# Create a workflow with the router and specialized agents
workflow = RouterAgentWorkflow(
    router=RouterAgent(),
    agents={
        "weather": WeatherAgent(),
        "news": NewsAgent()
    }
)
```

## 4. Agent Handoff Pattern

The Agent Handoff Pattern transfers conversations between different agents with different expertise areas.

### Implementation Example

```python
from openai_agents import Agent, AgentState, Message, HandoffAgentWorkflow

class InitialAgent(Agent):
    async def run(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
        # Process initial query and determine if handoff is needed
        # ...
        return state

class SpecialistAgent(Agent):
    async def run(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
        # Handle specialized queries after handoff
        # ...
        return state

# Create a workflow with handoff capability
workflow = HandoffAgentWorkflow(
    initial_agent=InitialAgent(),
    specialist_agents={
        "technical": SpecialistAgent(),
        "customer_service": SpecialistAgent()
    }
)
```

## 5. Voice Integration Pattern

The Voice Integration Pattern adds audio input/output capabilities to agents.

### Implementation Example

```python
from openai_agents import Agent, AgentState, Message, SingleAgentVoiceWorkflow

class VoiceAgent(Agent):
    async def run(self, state: AgentState) -> AgentState:
        # Process voice input and generate response
        # ...
        return state

# Create a workflow with voice capabilities
workflow = SingleAgentVoiceWorkflow(
    agent=VoiceAgent(),
    voice_settings={
        "voice": "alloy",
        "model": "tts-1"
    }
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the Right Pattern**: Select the pattern that best fits your use case to avoid unnecessary complexity.
2. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling in your agents, especially when using external tools.
3. **State Management**: Be careful with the AgentState object, as it contains the entire conversation history.
4. **Testing**: Create unit tests for your agents to ensure they behave as expected in different scenarios.
5. **Documentation**: Document your agent implementations, especially any custom tools or routing logic.
